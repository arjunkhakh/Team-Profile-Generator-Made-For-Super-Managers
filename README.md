# Team-Profile-Generator-Made-For-Super-Managers

## Description
In this assignment, I was tasked to create a Team Profile Generator for a Manager to use to create their team. In the application, you would open it by using 'node index.js' in the terminal and it will put you through a series of questions! Each answer which is submitted will be inputted into the HTML file which is generated after each bank of questions is answered. The Manager can add Engineers and Interns to this profile generator!

## Technologies Used
I used a few npm packages to get this to work. I had used inqurier and fs. I used inqurier to prompt the user input into the html and I used fs to write up the HTML code that will be generated with all the html from the functions it is linked to.
